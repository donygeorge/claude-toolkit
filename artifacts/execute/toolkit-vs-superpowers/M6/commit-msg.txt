Split setup-toolkit into 4 focused skills (M6)

Replace the monolithic 2158-line setup-toolkit skill with 4 dedicated
skills, each with clear trigger conditions and phase-based workflows:

- toolkit-setup: Project onboarding and reconfiguration (Phase 0-8)
- toolkit-update: Version updates with rollback support (Phase U0-U5)
- toolkit-doctor: Health diagnostics with severity system (Phase H0-H7)
- toolkit-contribute: Upstream contributions with generalizability checks (Phase C0-C5)

Update all cross-references in CLAUDE.md, README.md, reference.md,
CONTRIBUTING.md, bootstrap.sh, BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md, cmd-explain.sh.
Update skill count from 12 to 15 in tests and documentation.
