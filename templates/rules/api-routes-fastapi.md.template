# API Route Rules (FastAPI) — {{PROJECT_NAME}}

- Use FastAPI dependency injection for shared resources
- Return proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 422, 500)
- Validate inputs early, fail fast
- Routes delegate to services — never put business logic in route handlers
- Before completing API work, check for breaking changes:
  - Removed/renamed response fields clients expect = BREAKING
  - Changed field types (string to int, etc.) = BREAKING
  - Added new optional fields = NOT breaking
  - New endpoints = NOT breaking

<!-- Add project-specific API route rules below -->
