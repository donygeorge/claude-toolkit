## Critical Rules

<!-- Add project-specific critical rules here -->

1. **Example Rule**: Description of the rule and why it matters

## Development Workflow

### Before ANY Task

1. **Read files you'll modify** - Entire file, not just the function
2. **Check existing patterns** - Match the code style already in use
3. **Identify ALL questions** - Ask in ONE batch upfront

### During Implementation

1. **Run `{{TEST_COMMAND}}`** after each logical chunk
2. **One logical change at a time** - Verify before moving to next

### Before Marking Complete

1. **Self-review checklist**:
   - [ ] `{{LINT_COMMAND}}` passes
   - [ ] `{{TEST_COMMAND}}` passes
   - [ ] Type hints on public functions
   - [ ] No hardcoded values that should be constants
